# HYPO
Repo for the "Hybrid Optimization Framework with Dynamic Transition Scheme for Large-scale Portfolio Management". Due to the internal policy, please send me a request email (lzlong@connect.hku.hk) for obtaining the implementation.

All data is collected from Yahoo Finance. The preprocessed data can be downloaded from ".\data.zip" in the repo. Each file has three columns including date, stock and daily_returns. The daily return is calculated by the adjusted close price.
